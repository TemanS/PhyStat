PhyStat is an application that returns maximum or optimal cardio and
metabolic values for a given age, gender, and height. The user can
enter the data in metric or English measure, and the results will be
displayed accordingly, where appropriate.

Current Status

The application is currently under development, so it is not fully 
functional. However, the interface is up and running, and we would
appreciate comments and contributions for improving it.
